# Introduction

Part of our becode training, we had to create a full stack website. Here is the main instruction given:

>Create a badge attribution system from an existing codebase. The login system is already partly done (you still have to create the frontend)You must find a way to store badges into a database. 
>There is two account types:
ADMINs who can create/edit/delete badges and grant them.
>NORMIEs who can receive badges
You must keep most of the logic outside of pages, into functions, for readability
>BONUS: Organize badges by topics so you can display a progression

Find our second attempt to a fullstack website [here](http://www.mariefourriere.rf.gd/)

To access to the website:
* ADMIN LOGIN: admin@example.com | PASSWORD: GraceHopper<3
* NORMIE LOGIN: normie@example.com | PASSWORD: I<3PHP

# Setup

### Github
We worked with github to share our code. Find the repo [here](https://github.com/NalessoAxel/breaking_badge).
```git
git init
git clone (url)
```
### Management
We used [Github projects](https://github.com/NalessoAxel/breaking_badge/projects/1) to keep track of our work process and made mornings and afternoons briefs to stay aligned with the final objectives.

### Design
Here is a prototype of the website to get the frontend started ![image](/assets/img/prototype.jpeg) 

Here is the plan of our future database and tables
